# swapnodes

## Description 

This mod adds some nodes to the Minetest Game that swap to falling nodes when punched. These falling nodes will disappear after a certain time.

You can think of these nodes as framed sand, desert sand, silver sand and gravel. Punching one node removes the frame and leads to it falling on its own without taking all its neighbors falling with it.
Therefore, the nodes can be used for games similar to "spleef" or [Tntrun](https://gitlab.com/zughy-friends-minetest/tntrun).

All nodes are not given in the inventory, unbreakable, blast-proofed, not possible to drop and stopper for the mesesons piston.

This mod was highly influenced by the mods [tnt](https://github.com/minetest/minetest_game/tree/master/mods/tnt) and [maptools](https://github.com/minetest-mods/maptools).

The frame texture is taken from the mod [fachwerk](https://github.com/jbruechert/fachwerk).
